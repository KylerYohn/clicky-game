#Clicky-Memory-Game!

##Concept behind the app
The idea for this application is to have a user play a memory game with the pictures that are displayed on the screen. The user is to click one image and then the images will be shuffled randomly. If the user clicks the same image they have clicked before then they will have lost the game and their score will reset, But if they click a different image than one they previously clicked this will give them a point and will allow the user to continue.

##technology used
This application was created using React and JSX
